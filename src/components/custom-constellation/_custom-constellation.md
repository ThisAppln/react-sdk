# The **components/custom-constellation** directory

The **src/components/custom-constellation** directory contains the code for Constellation-related _companion_ components of custom components that you create and use with the **React SDK**.
These _companion_ components are used to show the preview of the custom component in App Studio when you are authoring your application and refer to your custom component.
