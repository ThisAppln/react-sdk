# The **override/forms** directory

The **src/components/override/forms** directory contains the code for **form** components for which you want to override the default implementation for use with the **React SDK**.

As you run the **npm run  create** command to override the default implementation of a **form** component, the generated code that you can use as a starting point for your component development will be placed in type-specific and component-specific folders in **src/components/override**.
